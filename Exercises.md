##EXERCISE

- Using `cd` and `ls`, go in to the 'shell-ecology/data' directory
and list its contents.
- How many files, how many directories and how many programs are there?

##EXERCISE

Now, we're going on a file hunt.
- Move around in the 'hidden' directory and try to find the file 'youfoundit.txt'

##EXERCISE

- Try finding the 'anotherfile.txt' file without changing directories.

##EXERCISE

- List the contents of the /bin directory. Do you see anything
familiar in there?

##EXERCISE

- What happens if you do `ls survey*csv`? How is that different than
'ls *survey*csv'
- Do each of the following using a single `ls` command without
navigating to a different directory.

1.  List all of the files in `/bin` that start with the letter 'c
2.  List all of the files in `/bin` that contain the letter 'a'
3.  List all of the files in `/bin` that end with the letter 'o'

BONUS: List all of the files in '/bin' that contain the letter 'a' or 'c'

##EXERCISE

- Find the line number in your history for the last exercise (listing
files in /bin) and reissue that command.

#EXERCISE

-  Print out the contents of the `~/shell-ecology/data/biology/plots.csv'
    file. What does this file contain?

-  Without changing directories, (you should still be in `shell-ecology`),
    use one short command to print the contents of all of the files in
    the `/home/username/shell-ecology/data/biology` directory.

##EXERCISE

- Search for the species "Reithrodontomy" in the species.csv file

- Search for that species in all the csv files.

- Search for all the records of "Reithrodontomys megalotis" in the surveys.csv file.  
Hint: Use the 'species.csv' file to figure out the species code

##EXERCISE

Do the following:

1.  Rename the `surveys_IMPORTANT.csv` file to `surveys_new.csv`.
2.  Create a directory in the `biology` directory called `new`
3.  Then, copy the `surveys_new.csv` file into `new`

##Exercise

Open 'awesome.sh' and add "echo AWESOME!" after the grep command and save the file.

We're going to come back and use this file in just a bit.
